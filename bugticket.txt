Small comment: The provided acceptance critaria was not developed into a proper scenario in the "3 amigos" meeting
    so the Given / When / Then is my interpretation. A more detail acceptance criteria with what is being expected when the user does not provide his name should be specified.

_____________________________________________
Bug id: 01

Description: A user is still able to adopt an animal even if he doesn't provide his name

Feature: animal adoption

Steps to reproduce: Run the scenario number 4 to guide the developt.
        Given I navigate to animal adoption home page
        When I don't provide my name 
        And I press continue button
        Then I should be still located on home page
        And an error message should be displayed providing the proper feedback to the user

        Expected result: 
        It should keep the user on the home page and display and error message that the name is mandatory. 
        This part is a suggestion from my side, we can involve the project owner and see how to properly handle this acceptance criteria
        
        Actual result: 
        The user is being navigated to the second page - animal selection.
